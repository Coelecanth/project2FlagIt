# High Level Test Strategy 
- Responsiveness -  tested across mutiple screen size and devices 
- User testing - Game flow and interaction 
- Javascript operation 
- javascript automated testing  
- validation of code - see section below  
- performance of pages/code - see section below 

## MarkUp Validation -  
The W3C Markup Validator were used to validate all page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.
- W3C Markup Validator - Results can be seen in the results section later in this document 


## Device base 
The follwoing devices were tested against, these were selected to provide a broad but common base of devices  

Emulated devices using Google Chrome emulator   
- Iphone XR 
- galaxy s20 
- Ipad mini 
- Kindle fire 
- Ipad Pro
Physical device 
- PC desktop -  Firefox, Chrome, and Edge
- Samsung s22 Ultra - Firefox and Chrome 
- Samsung s20 Ultra 
- Samsung Flip     
- iphone XR

### Browser 
The site was tested on the following browsers acroos the above devices :
 - Safari
 - Google Chrome
 - Mozilla Firefox
 - Microsoft Edge

## Test plan
The testing on these platfroms was really completed by exercising the game and looking for any erronous behaviour/situations that developed. in particular 
I tested the following features when exercising the game

- Game page responsiveness 
- User features - reduce scrolling while playing 
- User feature - Questions for game change
- User features - navigation bar works 
    - changes size when viewport reduces 
    - navbar open and closes when clicked 


Where testing produced problems/bugs, those that required remediation are documented in the TTesting Issues and Resolution section

# Testing Issues and Resolution

### 1. Bug - Game Flow behaviour after Start Pressed  
Problem found when AFTER the "Start" button is clicked in the game, the "Next" and "Restart Game" button is active even though no answer has been selected.
This would cause the game to go into a dead game state and you would have to relaod the page.  
### Resoloution 
The resolution to this was to hide the buttons so that they could not used and thi also follows the idea of removing game estate to make the game more playable. what was perfomred was to hide the buttons until after an answer button had been pressed. 


### 2. Bug - Game Flow behaviour with reset Button after start 
Steps to reproduce 
1. Once a game has been played (and scores are recorded). 
2. The player then presses Start and the game is started again. 
3. If you now press the reset button, having not selected any answers, 
4. The game ends, and "End of Game" Modal is shown, and the scores from the previous game are shown. 
the scores should have been zeroed at the end of the game in step 1

#### Resolution 
This happens as the scores have been written to the modal page, and the modal page values had not 
been reset as part of the restart process. 
This was fixed by resetting the scores values in the modal page as part of the reset.

### 3. Bug - Game Responsiveness with Game page when playing 
|Responsiveness of the main flag panel on small screens| 
| ------------------------| 
| The below images show the issue | 
| ![screenshot](documentation/img/mis-flag.avif) |
 
 To control the space in the Flag Panel I used the boot strap grid, with 1 row and 3 columns. 
 This gave me alignmnet and spacing, but becuas the game hides buttons at different points of the game 
 and when playing on small dvives it would cause the last column to wrap, causing the flag and butons to lose all ther ealignment.

 #### Resolution 
  The resolution to this was to change the Bootstrap grid to 3 rows, with one column in each row, 
  and set the buttons to be displayed in a block in the column.
  This then aligns the buttons and image without issue, and resizes gracefully as the screen port chjanges.   
   


### 4 Game Responsiveness of the Footer on Small Screens 
On reducing the viewport size the responsiveness would alter both image and
banner cuasing the the image and text to clash 

|Responsiveness of the footer on small screens| 
| ------------------------| 
| The below images show the issue | 
| ![screenshot](documentation/img/footer-clash.avif) |
#### Resolution
Intially i reoslved this by hiding the flag Icon at small screen size using bootstrap 
setting for small on the image eg d-none d-sm-none d-md-block. However upon 
reviewing this further when using some of the other pages the texts was causing an issue, 
reducing the text size just made the copyright unreadable. So it became advantagous just to hide 
the whole copyright banner at small screen sizes, on all pages except the home page. 
Which still retains the text.     

### 5 Game Flow - Game page
A bug was found where it was still possible to press an answer button when the game had finished. 
This would cause the game to go into a dead game state and you would have to relaod the page. 
#### Resolution
This was caused by some additions I had made to the game flow in the End of game routines and these 
had been added in the wrong place, this was rectified by altering the postions of statements 
eg the disable the answer buttons  

Feature-by-Feature Testing:

Go through each feature of your portfolio site and detail the testing process for each.

Explain the functionality and demonstrate how it aligns with the intended purpose. This could include:

- Navigation: Ensuring smooth transitions between pages, links directing to the correct destinations.
- Responsive Design: Checking for compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
- Portfolio Display: Verifying that projects are properly showcased with accurate descriptions, images, and links.
- Contact Form: Testing the form submission process, ensuring the user receives a confirmation, and you receive the message.

User Experience Testing:

- Usability Testing: Have users (or simulated users) interact with the site and provide feedback. Document any issues encountered and the resolutions implemented.
- Accessibility Testing: Confirm compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., screen reader compatibility, proper alt text for images, keyboard navigation).

Compatibility Testing:

- Browser Compatibility: Testing on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc.) to ensure consistent performance.
- Device Compatibility: Ensuring functionality across various devices (desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones).
- Performance Testing (optional):
	- Speed and Load Testing: Tools like PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix to check page load times and optimize where necessary.
	- Scalability Testing: Assess how the site handles increased traffic or usage.

Regression Testing:

After implementing fixes or updates, ensure that previous features and functionalities still work as intended. This prevents new changes from breaking existing features.

Documentation and Logs:

Maintain records of testing procedures, results, and any bugs encountered along with their resolutions. This helps demonstrate a systematic approach to testing and problem-solving.
User Feedback Incorporation:

If applicable, mention how user feedback has been taken into account and implemented to enhance the user experience.

## Code Validation

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Use the space to discuss code validation for any of your own code files (where applicable).
You are not required to validate external libraries/frameworks, such as imported Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide a screenshot for each file you validate.

**PRO TIP**: Always validate the live site pages, not your local code. There could be subtle/hidden differences.

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

| Directory | File | Screenshot | Notes |

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.
 When I ran jshint one error I could not remove was that one of the statements was calling the countryArray which was external to the file. So hence could not be resolved
 Like waise as the flag-dict just defines an array, there is no calling function in the file. Becuase the calling function are in the script files.

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various browsers.

Consider testing AT LEAST 3 different browsers, if available on your system.

You DO NOT need to use all of the browsers below, just pick any 3 (minimum).

Recommended browsers to consider:
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)
- [Firefox (Developer Edition)](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/developer)
- [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)
- [Safari](https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari)
- [Brave](https://brave.com/download)
- [Opera](https://www.opera.com/download)

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested browsers, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Please note, there are services out there that can test multiple browser compatibilities at the same time.
Some of these are paid services, but some are free.
If you use these, you must provide a link to the source used for attribution, and multiple screenshots of the results.

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site on various device sizes.

The minimum requirement is for the following 3 tests:
- Mobile
- Tablet
- Desktop

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the tested responsiveness, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

Using the "amiresponsive" mockup image (or similar) does not suffice the requirements.
Consider using some of the built-in device sizes in the Developer Tools.

If you have tested the project on your actual mobile phone or tablet, consider also including screenshots of these as well.
It showcases a higher level of manual tests, and can be seen as a positive inclusion!

Use this space to discuss testing the live/deployed site's Lighthouse Audit reports.
Avoid testing the local version (especially if developing in Gitpod), as this can have knock-on effects of performance.

If you don't have Lighthouse in your Developer Tools,
it can be added as an [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk).

Don't just test the home page (unless it's a single-page application).
Make sure to test the Lighthouse Audit results for all of your pages.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide screenshots of the results, to "prove" that you've actually tested them.

## Defensive Programming

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable.
Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website.
Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine,
consider documenting tests on each element of the page
(ie. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their happy flow,
and also the bad/exception flow, mentioning the expected and observed results,
and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | Expectation | Test | Result | Fix | Screenshot |

Testing user stories is actually quite simple, once you've already got the stories defined on your README.

Most of your project's **features** should already align with the **user stories**,
so this should as simple as creating a table with the user story, matching with the re-used screenshot
from the respective feature.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

Adjust the code below (file names, etc.) to match your own project files/folders.

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-END OF NOTES (to be deleted)

I have used the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) JavaScript testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to work with Jest, I first had to initialize NPM.

- `npm init`
- Hit `enter` for all options, except for **test command:**, just type `jest`.

Add Jest to a list called **Dev Dependencies** in a dev environment:

- `npm install --save-dev jest`

**IMPORTANT**: Initial configurations

When creating test files, the name of the file needs to be `file-name.test.js` in order for Jest to properly work.

Without the following, Jest won't properly run the tests:

- `npm install -D jest-environment-jsdom`

Due to a change in Jest's default configuration, you'll need to add the following code to the top of the `.test.js` file:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

const { test, expect } = require("@jest/globals");
const { function1, function2, function3, etc. } = require("../script-name");

beforeAll(() => {
    let fs = require("fs");
    let fileContents = fs.readFileSync("index.html", "utf-8");
    document.open();
    document.write(fileContents);
    document.close();
});
```

Remember to adjust the `fs.readFileSync()` to the specific file you'd like you test.
The example above is testing the `index.html` file.

Finally, at the bottom of the script file where your primary scripts are written, include the following at the bottom of the file.
Make sure to include the name of all of your functions that are being tested in the `.test.js` file.

```js
if (typeof module !== "undefined") module.exports = {
    function1, function2, function3, etc.
};
```

Now that these steps have been undertaken, further tests can be written, and be expected to fail initially.
Write JS code that can get the tests to pass as part of the Red-Green refactor process.

Once ready, to run the tests, use this command:

- `npm test`

**NOTE**: To obtain a coverage report, use the following command:

- `npm test --coverage`

Below are the results from the tests that I've written for this application:

| Test Suites | Tests | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 passed | 16 passed | ![screenshot](documentation/tests/js-test-coverage.png) |
| x | x | repeat for all remaining tests |

## Bugs

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

This section is primarily used for JavaScript and Python applications,
but feel free to use this section to document any HTML/CSS bugs you might run into.

It's very important to document any bugs you've discovered while developing the project.
Make sure to include any necessary steps you've implemented to fix the bug(s) as well.

**PRO TIP**: screenshots of bugs are extremely helpful, and go a long way!

## Unfixed Bugs

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.
