This is a game written for Project 2 of Software development level 5 diploma, the game is wrtiiten with HTML and Javascipt, it is both educational 

# Introduction 
So the project are to show a using javascipt and HTML. I chose to write a game.
the For this project I chose a game to idnetify the national flags of the world  

This is game that is written with HTMP and Javascipt, it is both educational and fun, and will be pleasing to use.

# User Experiences (UX) - User Stories

- make the game simple to use 

## As a potential user customer:

    
     
## Strategy

### Site Goals

This particular project is to design and create a static website that is done mainly through HTML and CSS., and use supporting code libraries such as Bootstrap. 
    
### Wireframes
![Wire Frames Colour For the  Fly fishing Lodge](/assets/readme-img/wirfr1-small.png?raw=true "Colour palette")
 
# Design
## Design developement 
From The wireframes creation, the development of the site was then delivered in the following steps 
Selection of: 
- Fonts - typograhy
- Colour scheme - selection of colour palette for the site 
- Icons - Icons required for the site  
- Images - Image selection for the site
- Build of the site - creating pages and then adding linking and features, and 
- Testing - Once the features, structure, had been established then clearer objectives for testing were created ad documented in the read.me (this document)
- Documenatation - this was doen throughout the process, adding the relevant comments in the site files and sections in the read.me (this document)  
  

## Colour scheme

The overall design for the home page and FAQ page was to have a white backdrop where all the text and images were placed, this would be accentuated using the colours from the chosen palette with fonts, coloured bands (housing Images) navbar, transaprent coloured framing boxes. the only real exception to this was in the following 
- The hero banner section of each page 
- The conmtact/form page which uses an image as the complete background.   

### Colour Palette
The colours within the chosen palette were chosen to provide a sympathetic colour represnrting the the typical colours found in a destination based in the Pacific north west forest region. Tints and Shades of these colours used are predominatly greens and browns with some leaning to blue. They were chosen using the site coolors.co located here 
https://coolors.co/002d00-2a2600-77bfa3-98c9a3-bfd8bd. 
     

![Colour Pallete for fly fishing lodge](/assets/readme-img/colour-pal.jpg?raw=true "Colour palette")

The colour reference and there names are as follows:


For reference and clarity these have been detailed in the style.css as a comment.


## Typography
Fonts I used  were chosen from Fontjoy.com which provides a mechanism to mix and match together fonts to provide aestically pleasing results. 

The following 3 fonts were chosen to provide good contrast in styles to each other and be symapthetic with the site and its function 

- Great Vibes - a script like font used in all the main titles, as suggested in fontjoy 
- Radley - used to provide contrast in all other heading as suggested in fontjoy 
- Karma - used throughtour in the body as suggested in fontjoy 

The Karma font is the main font used throughout the whole website used in the body test of pages. 
With Sans Serif as the fallback font (in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly). 
Karma is a clean font and differntitates strongly in compairison with great Vibes and is more complimnetary to Radley  

The Radley font is used throughout for heading in the page to provide moderate contrast to Karma
and Highlight against XXX 
the weight of the font was chosedn to be heavier to give a more bold appreance for headings .also used for Copyright

An additiona font of Great Vibes is used in the hero banner to create a less formal feel to the website, with a backup font of cursive. 
The font is a script like font and works well in larger sizes   

All fonts were sourced and referenced from google fonts and imported in the style.css 

## Icons




## Images

The images have been chosen to reflect the destination with pictures of fly fishing and fish, and the experience of the wilderness. This was by far, one of the most challenging tasks of completing this project. As the images needed to be very specific to fit the content of site. Because of this very specific nature of the images required, I used some of my personal pictures from previous trips i have made, to supplement the stock imagery. This was because of the scarcity of the right type of images. 

The images were sourced from: 
- Istock https://www.istockphoto.com/
- From my personal picture collection

## Home Page (index.html)
<img src="assets/readme-img/rm-ban2-211904.png">


### Gneral page structure 
used throughout the site 
compromises of the following structure 
Heading Banner 
Flag Bannner 
Answer Banner 
Score Banner 
Copyright Banner 

In addtion to this there are 2 modal pages used from the game 
these are 
End of Game Modal 
Game Options Modal 



## Footer/Navbar 

The footer will be fixed so as to allow user to move between pages regardless of where they on the page or site. This combined with the matching Navbar colour, will provide a seemless look to the nav?footer fixed to the bottom of the page. 
The navigation items will be icons sourced from font awesome using there libraries and CDN.   
The Navigartion bar will use Bootstrap to provide responsive for screen size using the navbar toggler, that means that at reduced screen sizes a menu will appear and only show icons once clicked,  the item will be shown horizontally across the screen to reduce the screen estate consumed in the mobile view. 
     
# Technologies Used 

## Languages
1. HTML5
1. CSS3 

## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used
### 1. [Bootstrap 5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)
- Bootstrap was used to assist with the capabiliites and responsiveness and styling of the website. It is used througout the site.

### 2. [JSdeliver](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/)  
- jSdeliver came with Bootstrap to make the navbar responsive, and is really only used for this aspect. It was deemed necessary, as at smaller screen sizes the icons depicted in the navbar consumend too much screen real estate. 

### 3. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) 
-  
### 4. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 
- Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub.
### 5. [GitHub:](https://github.com/) 
- GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

### 6. [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/)
- Gitpod was the IDE that i used to edit and build the html pages in, and dvelope an debug the javascript code with. 

 ### 7. [Squoosh](https://squoosh.app/)
- Squooosh was used to perform the following functions 
- convert the images from jpg to Avif 
- Also to resize (reduce pixel count) the images to a more managable size to improve download speed.

### 8. [Visio](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/install-visio-or-access-visio-for-the-web-f98f21e3-aa02-4827-9167-ddab5b025710) 
- Visio was used to create the wireframes during the design process. as this was a tool I am  very fmailar with and have license for. and I used this tool for expendency, over tools like Figma which would require me to learn. 
### 9. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- Google fonts was used to source the fonts that were sleected from FontAwesome. 

### 11. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) 
- Stack overflow was an invaluable resource I used for code validation, examples and research.

### 13. [FontJoy](https://fontjoy.com/)
- Font joy was used in the design process to create a palette of fonts, to be empathic with the site topic, and provide contrast between various type stying. 
    
**Quote** from https://fontjoy.com/  

 *The goal of font pairing is to select fonts that share an overarching theme yet have a pleasing contrast. Which fonts work together is largely a matter of intuition, but we approach this problem with a neural net.*

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

## Results-Resposiveness/Compatability 
This group of testing was specifically targeted to make sure that the site responded as it was designed to, 
with regard to the use of the Bootstrap grid and responsiveness.
The tests were carried out across multiple devices (Emulated and Physical) with differing screen sizes, 
which correspond to the following Bootstrap grid size e.g. Small Medium and Large.  

### The Sizes set in Bootstrap are:
- Small 	576px 
- Medium	≥768px
- Large 	≥992px
### Outcome 
The site performed as predicted with final tests no browsers issues found.

#### Devices Selected for Testing 
The devices selected were 
- Small (virtual)
- Iphone XR 
- galaxy s20 
- Medium (virtual)
- Ipad mini 
- Kindle fire 
- Large 
- Ipad Pro (virtual)
- Pc desktop (Physical device ) -  Firefox, Chrome, and IE

## Results-User testing
This group of testing was conducted to see if the wbsite met the criteris as stated in the User testing 
was conducted by a small number of users (family Memebrs)  who were not involved in the development of the site 
and were ask to use the site and then review the site based on the above test criteira 
### Outcome 
The site performed as expected by users and the criteria and no issues were encountered in test phase.    
### Additional user testing
During the whole developme of the site the userability of the site was one of the key considerations when it was being constructed and unit tested
so was subjected to thsi testing throughout the developemnt of the site.      

## Results-Hero banner  
During the development of the site the functionality of the her Bnnae r was tested and retested to make it comply with eh design 
So was subjected to testing throughout the developemnt of the site. 
### Expected outcome 
- the hero Immage and text would be resized and behave appropriattely across all devices and browsers
### Outcome 
- Resizing responsiveness of the text and iamge in the hero banner behaved as expected  

## Results-Image band 
During the development of the site the functionality of the her Image band was tested and retested to make it comply with eh design 
So was subjected to testing throughout the developemnt of the site. 
The Expected behaviour is:        
- small - The image would be stacked verically one over the other
- medium - The images would be stacked 2 over 1 (3rd image) 
- large - The 3 images would span across the page - horizontally   
### Outcome 
- Resizing responsiveness was observed across all devices 
#### Test result Images 

Image band at large size

Image band at Medium size

![Image band at medium size](/assets/readme-img/144513.png?raw=true "medium size")

## Results-Speed and Resposiveness
The speed and rendering for the site were tested with Lighthouse and [GtMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/) tools

#### Lighthouse testing 
Initally there was some downloading time issues observed which were corrected by 
converting all the images to avif and resizing the pixel to approx pixels per image (where possible) 

Post file conversersion the tool wwas still showing excessive rendering time of the images 
This was discovered to be a consequence of the use of bootstrap fluid parameter and and the number of images and pixel size
See Testing Issues for more information on this. 

Overall performance achieved was 80% or better in lighthousem, but could potentially be improved upon.   
![speed and render test result](/assets/readme-img/151519.png?raw=true "speed test result")

 

#### [GtMetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/) Testing 


The HTML Markup was cheked using w3c Markup validation checker 

When running this tool, there was a warning which advised to remove the <section> tag in faq.html page, 
as there was no Heading present. As this was intentional and the other option was to place it within 
<div> tag which was already had been done the <section> tag was removed.  

# Testing Issues and Resolution

### 1. Bug - Game Flow behaviour after Start Pressed  
Problem found when AFTER the "Start" button is clicked in the game, the "Next"  and Restart Game button is active even though no answer has been selected.
this was cooorected  
### Resoloution 
Hide buttons until answer buttons have been pressed 


### 2. Game Flow behaviour with reset Button after start 
Once a game has been played (scores recorded), and the game is started again with Start, if you now press the reset button the scores from the previous game are shown. 
### Resolution 
This happens as the scores have been written to the modal page, and had not been reset as part of the restart process, this was fixed by resetting the scores values in the modal page as part of the reset.

### 3. Game Flow 



### 4 Game responsiveness

icon in the copy right banner at smallscreen clashed with copyright 
resolved this by hiding Icon at small screen size using bootstrap setting for small 

### 5 Game responsiveness on samll screens - main flag Image 
![Flag position on small screen ](/assets/readme/mis-flag.avif?raw=true "Wrong positioned flag on small screen")
